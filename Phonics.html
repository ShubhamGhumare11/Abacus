        <h2>Introduction - What is ABACUS?</h2>
        <h4>If you are looking for to learn abacus at home for kids, you are at the right place. How to learn abacus at home for kids? Let's first understand the basics of ABACUS.</h4>
        <h4>The abacus is the most ancient calculating device known. It consists of a wooden frame, rods, and beads. Each rod represents a different place value—ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Each bead represents a number, usually 1 or 5, and can be moved along the rods. One can perform addition and subtraction easily by moving beads along the wires of the abacus. In short, it is a simple tool used for fast and accurate calculations. It helps develop right-brain and overall intelligence. There are many other benefits, it helps improve,</h4>
       
        <h2>Why is Reading Important?</h2>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <h4><strong>The right grasp is important</strong></h4>
        <p>The Department for Education National Curriculum for England states that reading helps pupils to develop culturally, emotionally, intellectually, and socially.</p>
        <p>An important goal of PHONICS is to enable young learners to become fluent readers and this is the best way to develop pupils' comprehension skills and love of reading, and prepare them for success in the school.</p>
        <p>As their reading skills develop, pupils gain the ability to read a wide variety of material, including stories, poems, and non-fiction. This extensive reading broadens their vocabulary, develops their general knowledge, and allows them to acquire self-knowledge. It is also believed that when children share in the lives of others, they see the world through new eyes and develop a greater capacity for empathy. In addition, reading may actually help to increase the young reader's intelligence by laying down new neural pathways in the brain.</p>
 
        <h2>How Can Phonics Help?</h2>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <h4><strong>Phonics is an important method to develop reading fluency.</strong></h4>
        <p>Phonics teaches pupils that letters they see written on a page are part of a code which represents the sounds of spoken language, and provides them with the tools to understand that code. With these skills they develop into fluent readers who are able to quickly recognize familiar words and to easily sound out new words they encounter.</p>
        <p>Phonics allows young readers to develop their reading comprehension. With practice, pupils' decoding skills become so automatic that they are able to concentrate on and easily understand the overall meaning of what they are reading.</p>
        <p>Phonics also raises children's <strong>phonemic awareness.</strong> This is the ability to understand how words are formed, and to break them down into individual sounds. For example, if a teacher asks "what are the sounds in the word ball" pupils will answer "b" "aw" and "l". This helps them not only with reading but also with spelling and writing. A study conducted by educational psychologist Marlynne Grant from 2011 to 2013 followed the progress of a group of children from reception to Year Two. The study found that pupils in classes who began a phonics program in Reception and received small group teaching if they fell behind were well ahead of the level expected for their age. They were ahead by an average of 28 months for reading and 21 months for spelling. By the end of the study the most successful child, a 7 year old boy, attained a 13 years and 9 months level in reading and a 14 years and nine months level in spelling.</p>

                Phonics is considered one of the best methods for teaching children to read because it focuses on the relationship between sounds and letters, which builds a strong foundation for reading skills. Phonics makes learning to read easier, simpler and crucially gets children reading quicker. This helps to increase a child's confidence and instill a love of reading from an early age. Rather than memorizing 1,000's of words, children are instead taught a phonics 'code'. This code helps children work out how to read 95% of the English language.
