        <h2>How to improve Handwriting Skills?</h2>
        <h4><strong>Activate your child's brain through handwriting</strong></h4>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>Good handwriting is achieved by finding the right grasp and posture for the pencil. If the pencil is not
            grasped correctly, the writing won’t flow quickly and easily. The correct way of holding the pencil is to
            rest it next to the base of the thumb. The child should hold the pencil lightly but firmly with his or her
            thumb, middle finger, and index finger. This will allow them to write more without fatiguing their fingers.
            This is the first basic step in developing best handwriting skills.</p>


        <h4><strong>Following the line is key</strong></h4>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>One problem many children face is keeping their letters in proportion with one another while also following
            the line. This results in the words appearing mismatched, with each character a different size and going out
            of the line of flow. Parents and educators can help their children overcome this problem by following
            certain methods, such as making them practice writing on lined paper so that they can fill up the space
            between the lines properly. Make sure the capital letters fill the space between the top and bottom lines,
            and see to it that the lowercase letters are about half the size of the capital letters. There are specially
            lined notebooks with blue and red markings which help kids with poor handwriting overcome their difficulties
            with this problem.</p>

        <h4><strong>Improving the pace of writing</strong></h4>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>Most children have a tendency to put a lot of pressure on the paper or notebook they are writing on. This
            will not only spoil their handwriting but also stress their fingers and tire them out very quickly. Children
            should be taught to hold the writing tool lightly but firmly, and not apply an excess of pressure on the
            paper while writing. By following this step, the words will glide easily and the handwriting will end up
            neat and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <h4><strong>Keeping sustainable pressure</strong></h4>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>Learning the algorithms means memorizing step by step moves and in a particular order. There is usually no
            mistake allowed with algorithms. This will train your brain to memorize and map things in their order.</p>


        <h4><strong>Training through tools and handwriting kits</strong></h4>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>There are many handwriting tools and kits available in the market that can help children improve their best
            handwriting skills. For example, Zaner-Bloser solutions are amongst the most globally acclaimed tools, used
            by schools and parents all over the world to enable young kids to improve their handwriting. These
            handwriting solutions are aimed at grades K to 6 and consist of a mix of print and digital solutions.
            Zaner-Bloser’s handwriting program is a definitive package for handwriting instruction which teaches
            students to write fluently and legibly in fewer than fifteen minutes a day, from their first letters all the
            way up to cursive script.</p>
